# this.design-react

This is the code for this.design. It is built on React using `prismic.io` as its’ CMS.

## Layout

The site is built with three containers. `root`, `about`, and `work`. The main container is `root`, which contains the homepage video as well as the case studies. When the `view` changes, it’s reflected in the DOM by adding a classname to the `.views` wrapper. Those classes are as follows:

| .-view-is-root                                                                                            | .-view-is-about                                                                                           | .-view-is-work                                                                                            |

| The default view. This is where the homepage and case studies are viewed from.                            | The about view as the name states, is where the about section is held.                                    | The work view is where all of the links to case studies are held                                          |



## Routing

The site uses React Router v4. Because of the heavy reliance on animation, RR is used imperatively. RR captures the url and changes the `view` and `currentCaseStudy` based on it.

When the user clicks on a case study from the `work` view, it changes the `view` state and modifies the url accordingly
