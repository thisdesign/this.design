This is the repo for email template for This.design.

## MJML

This template uses mjml to handle the gross parts of html emails.

[Start here](https://mjml.io/)

## Compiling

In order to use the email template, you need to compile it into html.  There is a plugin for most code editors.  You can also copy and paste your template to the [online tool](https://mjml.io/try-it-live),  or use a [stand alone app](https://mjmlio.github.io/mjml-app/).  I prefer to use the VSCode plugin, but pick your poison.

## Deploy

Once you are ready to go, just copy and paste your template into your mailchimp campaign.

### Enjoy!
